# DeepSpeech 2-Inspired Automatic Speech Recognition with TensorFlow

This repository provides a TensorFlow implementation for building a DeepSpeech 2-inspired model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model converts audio recordings into text transcripts.

Features:

Leverages CNNs and Bidirectional GRUs for feature extraction and sequence processing
Employs CTC loss for sequence labeling
Includes data preparation, training, and inference functionalities
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-tf.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (if you have a requirements.txt file)
Usage:

Prepare your Dataset:
Ensure your audio data is in WAV format (pre-processing might be required).
Modify the filepaths and transcriptions lists in the code to point to your data.
Train the Model:
Run the training script: python train.py (replace train.py with your actual script name, if different).
Perform Inference on New Audio:
Execute the inference script: python inference.py test_audio.wav (replace inference.py and test_audio.wav with your actual script and audio file names, if different).
